## Coding Standards

### PHP Code Style

* Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused
* Use type hints where possible (PHP 7.4+)

### Example:

```php
<?php

/**
 * Get user by email address
 *
 * @param string $email User's email address
 * @return array|false User data or false if not found
 */
public function getUserByEmail(string $email)
{
    $this->db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email');
    $this->db->bind(':email', $email);
    
    return $this->db->single();
}
```

### JavaScript Code Style

* Use modern ES6+ syntax where appropriate
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Use semicolons consistently

### SQL

* Use UPPERCASE for SQL keywords
* Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
* Use meaningful table and column names

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Examples:

```
Add user authentication feature

- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add session management
- Create user registration form

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

* Test your changes thoroughly before submitting
* Include test cases if applicable
* Verify that existing functionality still works

* Update the README.md if you change functionality
* Comment your code where necessary
* Update inline documentation for functions and classes
